Over the last weeks we worked hard on getting the New Tab Page into Firefox. It’s not quite ready yet but we need your help testing it. We enabled it by default on Nightly and decided to give it a week on Aurora to get feedback from those users as well.

Nightly: <http://nightly.mozilla.org/>  
Aurora: <https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/aurora/>

We’ll disable it for Aurora again on February 16th (next Thursday). If you liked the feature and want it back then just set the preference ‘browser.newtab.url’ to ‘about:newtab’, ‘browser.newtabpage.enabled’ to ‘true’ and restart the browser. You can easily file bugs using the following link:

Please make sure you don’t report a duplicate bug and check the dependencies of the original New Tab Page bug before filing – [bug 455553](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=455553 "Bug 455553 - New Tab Page feature").

title: "Firefox Panorama: Sync Integration with the Add-on-SDK"

Back in early April 2011 I started to write a small prototype add-on that allows to see tabs from your synchronized mobile devices as special groups in Panorama. While I’m not quite sure how these groups should behave (Should the be immutable? Should that synchronization be bi-directional?) it simply works as described.

This serves as a good example on how to write extensions using the great Add-on SDK that combine the powers of Panorama and Sync. Feel free to ask me anything about it or just send some pull requests:

As my time is pretty limited at the moment I would be really glad to see anyone pick up the development of *sync-for-panorama* or just build similar functionality. If that still doesn’t sound interesting then just be reminded of all the possibilities that extensions offer to you by connecting all these awesome features that are included in Firefox and realize your own ideas!

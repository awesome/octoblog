Time goes by so incredibly fast... This day marks the beginning of my third year
working for Mozilla. It has been an amazing trip since then for me.

Joined Mozilla in the run to Firefox 4.  
We completely changed our release cycle.  
We were fighting to stay relevant in the browser market.  
Continued to deliver new ES6 JavaScript features.  
Rust started to gain momentum. Started Servo as a research project. Samsung.  
We announced FirefoxOS and we're going to ship it soon in Brazil.  
Taras started the Snappy team/project and Firefox became faster again.  
Nicholas Nethercote started the MemShrink project and we became a market leader.  
IonMonkey, JÃ¤germonkey, new Baseline-JIT, OdinMonkey/ASM.js,  
WebRTC and Retina support.  
15 years anniversary.  
Firefox for Android.  
DevTools.

My name is Tim Taubert (ttaubert on IRC and Twitter). I work as a Firefox Engineer for Mozilla, based in Berlin, Germany.

## Here are the rules for this meme:

*Link to your original tagger(s) and list these rules in your post. Share seven facts about yourself in the post. Tag seven people at the end of your post by leaving their names and the links to their blogs. Let them know they’ve been tagged.*

I wasn’t tagged by anyone but after reading [Jared Wein’s blog post](http://msujaws.wordpress.com/2011/07/21/seven-things-you-may-or-may-not-have-wanted-to-know-about-me/) I felt inspired to do the same and keep the idea alive.

## These are my seven things:

1. At the age of sixteen I started to play multiple instruments, including guitar, piano and drums. I may not be the best musician out there and have quite a hard time reading music but it’s a lot of fun anyway. My current band is called “Rabbit Wrong” (which is easier to understand with a German background) and I play a white and adorable Gibson Studio connected to an Engl Screamer.

2. I have always been a big fan of guinea pigs. Three of them live at my home and they are called Charlie, Whiskey and Sydney.

3. Back in 2008 I managed to contribute ~12 lines of code to the Linux kernel 2.6.25 to add support for my newly bought USB TV adapter. (<http://linuxtv.org/pipermail/linux-dvb/2008-January/022742.html> and <http://lwn.net/Articles/266704/>)

4. All electronic devices I own (including TV, mobile phones, a tablet and laptops) are set to English language (hint, I’m German). I always loved everything about English – I watch movies and sitcoms almost exclusively in English and guess which language all my books are written in.

5. My first car about 4-5 yours ago was a sixteen years old Renault Rapid. It was assembled out of three wrecks of the same type. I used to call it the “death mobile” because it was really old and rusty, also the brakes didn’t work very well.

6. I’ve been a vegetarian for almost two years now and I feel quite good about it. I’m not one of those who tries to talk you into that but I’m much more comfortable about my own way of life since then. And that’s what counts in the first place.

7. One of my first employers was an agency for digital communication in Berlin. They were apparently very pleased with my work and decided to introduce the “Tim Taubert Award” that is bestowed on every Christmas staff party. There have been three award winners so far, me being the first one :)

I got to spend Wednesday through Friday in Edinburgh last week to attend
[Scotland.JS](http://www.scotlandjs.com/). Edinburgh is a lovely city and I will
definitely return to explore it a little more. It has great people, beers, food
and even a castle - what could one want more?

I arrived on Wednesday, just in time for the
[TechMeetup](http://techmeetup.co.uk/). It took place in the Appleton Tower and
had about 70-80 attendees with quite diverse technical backgrounds. I had a very
interesting talk to a freelance patent attorney. I also met a couple of people
I knew from recent conferences and meetups in Berlin. Free pizza and beers and
two interesting talks.  After the TechMeetup was over we met most of the people
in a pub right next to the Appleton Tower. Cue more beers and tech conversations.

Thursday was the first day of Scotland.JS that started with a great keynote from
[Jan Lehnardt](https://twitter.com/janl). The most memorable talk of the day was
about Functional Reactive Programming using Bacon.js by
[Philip Roberts](https://twitter.com/philip_roberts). I am still blown away by
how DOM events can be seen as streams and combined. There of course were a lot
more great talks but Bacon.js kept my head spinning the most.  At the end of the
day we went to a neat pub near the venue and I headed to bed rather early, still
a little tired from travel and the day before.

Friday started with a short 20-minute walk through Edinburgh's old town that I
needed to pass on my way to the venue. My favorite talks of the second and last
day include "Embracing IndexedDB" by [Huong Vu (Zi)](https://twitter.com/hungryzi)
and "The database of the future: leveldb" by
[Dominic Tarr](https://twitter.com/dominictarr). I also really enjoyed
"Hyperaudio - Making Audio a First Class Citizen of the Web" by
[Mark Boas](https://twitter.com/maboa) - a very entertaining and impressive mix
of technologies applied to journalism. A GitHub drinkup in the venue's own pub
was a great way to end the conference. Lots of good conversations with
Scotland.JS attendees and speakers as well as people from the local tech
community and visitors of the (back then upcoming) Scottish Ruby Conf.

I flew home the very next day and already miss Edinburgh with its neat little
alleys and pubs everywhere. The JavaScript community has once again shown how
different it is from other communities I've been a member of so far. Nice and
welcoming people coming from different backgrounds play an important role in the
intestering mix of people representing the JavaScript community.

Like after most conferences I feel a little exhausted and my head is full of
ideas for future or current (side-)projects. I will definitely try my best to
return next year, it has been a lot of fun!

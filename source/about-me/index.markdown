title: "About me"
---

I live and was born in Berlin, Germany. I spend most of my time coding, reading books about coding, making music or riding my motorbike.

I love JavaScript and Ruby. I'm pretty experienced in PHP as well. I post things on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ttaubert). My code usually goes on [GitHub](https://github.com/ttaubert). I'm on [XING](https://www.xing.com/profile/Tim_Taubert) and [LinkedIn](http://www.linkedin.com/pub/tim-taubert/43/368/703) but can't promise to keep those profiles up-to-date.

As of April 2011, I work as a Firefox Engineer for Mozilla.  
You can contact me via [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ttaubert) or [email](mailto:tim@timtaubert.de).
